# Contributing to these docs

We are using [nuxt content](https://content.nuxt.com/) + [Docus](https://docus.dev/) to generate these docs.

All the config to generate the site lives in the [docs](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/wican-fw/tree/main/docs) folder, and the pages themself live in [docs/content](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/wican-fw/tree/main/docs/content). To update any of these pages simple fork this repository, and update the files in the docs/content folder and submit a PR for approval to get your updates showing.

## Quick Edits
