# MQTT

Currently only non-secure MQTT is supported, it's highly recommended that you only use it with local MQTT broker and not use public brokers otherwise your CAN bus might be publicly exposed.

To use the MQTT client it has to be enabled on the "Settings" tab:

Of couse the broker, topics and logging have to be configured as well:

The [WiCAN device ID](../0.Config/1.WiFi.md) is part of the topics in order to be able to communicate with multiple WiCAN devices if needed.
