## Home Assistant

WiCAN integrates seamlessly with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) using the official integration, which communicates via HTTP, eliminating the need for MQTT. We recommend using the official integration for the best experience.

Alternatively, WiCAN can still connect to Home Assistant via MQTT. For setup instructions, refer to the [MQTT guide](/home-assistant/mqtt/).

MQTT support is also available for use with other applications.
