Welcome to the WiCAN docs.

Use the menu to find various pages. Also checkout out the [contributing](/contributing) page on how to add and update these docs.

All the docs assume you are running the latest version of the WiCAN Firmware, please make sure you keep your firmware up to date.

These docs are very new, and defiantly still a work in progress. Feel free to help out and migrate helpful content from the main README.md, and various issues/discussions all in here to get them in in a central place
